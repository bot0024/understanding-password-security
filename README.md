# Password Security Evaluation

This repository analyzes password strength using [The Password Meter](https://www.passwordmeter.com/). It demonstrates how different passwords score based on complexity rules and offers guidance on creating strong passwords.

## 🔍 Evaluated Passwords

| Password            | Score | Complexity   |

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Use a mix of **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**
- Avoid dictionary words and predictable patterns
- Aim for **8+ characters**
- Don't reuse passwords

## 🔐 About Password Attacks

### Common Attacks:
- **Brute-force:** Tries every possible combination
- **Dictionary:** Tries common words and variations
- **Credential stuffing:** Uses leaked username/password pairs

### How Complexity Helps
Longer, more random, and varied passwords are exponentially harder to crack using brute force or dictionaries.
